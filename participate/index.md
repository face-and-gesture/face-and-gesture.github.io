We cordially invite you to submit your short papers/long papers/workshops and special sessions proposals for the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG2023).

The 17th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2023) will be held in Hawaii, USA, 4-8 Jan 2023. This FG conference will be co-located with the IEEE WACV conference, which will be held 2-6 Jan 2023. The IEEE conference series on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition is the premier international forum for image and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition research. Its broad scope includes advances in fundamental computer vision, pattern recognition, and computer graphics; machine learning techniques relevant to face, gesture, and body motion; interdisciplinary research on behavioral analysis; new algorithms and applications. For this year, our conference theme is on privacy and ethical issues of FG research. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

-  Face recognition & biometrics
- Face analysis and synthesis
- Body action and activity recognition
- Gesture recognition, analysis, and synthesis
- Affective computing and multi-modal interaction
- Psychological and behavioral analysis
- Perceptual and cognitive aspects of non-verbal interaction
- Databases and tools for FG
- Technologies and applications related to FG
- Privacy and ethical issues of FG
