<div align="center"><h3>Paper Submission Guidelines</h3></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Submissions to FG 2023 should have no substantial overlap with any other paper already submitted or published, or to be submitted during the FG 2023 review period. All persons who have made any substantial contribution to the work should be listed as authors, and all listed authors should have made some substantial contribution to the work. All authors should be aware that the paper is submitted to FG 2023.

Papers presented at FG 2023 will be sent for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore digital library, including workshop papers. If a paper is accepted, it is assumed that an author will register and attend the conference to present the paper. (Papers that are not presented will not be published in IEEE Xplore.) The authors of the best-reviewed FG 2023 papers will be invited to submit an extended version of the paper to a special issue of Important Journal.

The reviewing process for FG 2023 will be “double-blind” so the submitted version of the paper should be appropriately anonymized so as not to reveal the authors or authors’ institutions. Authors will have the opportunity to address issues raised by the reviewers during a rebuttal period before the final decision is made.

The submission process will be handled through the [CMT System](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/fg2023/). Submissions may be up to eight pages in the conference paper format. Papers longer than six pages will be subject to a page fee (100 USD per page) for the extra pages (two max). Submissions have to be in pdf format and are limited to a 10MB file size. Papers that use different formatting from the FG 2023 Latex or Word templates have more than eight pages, or explicitly reveal the authors’ identity will be automatically removed from the reviewing process.

Supplementary material (images, video, etc.) may optionally be submitted with papers, but be sure to maintain anonymity, including the file properties or other hidden text. The supplemental material has a file size limit of 100MB. The supplemental materials will not be part of the conference proceedings, so they are only there to aid the reviewing process. Reviewers are not required to view the supplemental material (though most reviewers are likely to do so), so any information critical to understanding the work should be in the main paper.

All supplementary material must be self-contained and zipped into a single file. The following formats are allowed: avi, mp4, pdf, wmv. Note that reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so.

**SUBMISSION STEPS**

1. Prepare your manuscripts as per the IEEE specification using the following templates:
2. Carefully proofread your submission;
3. Submit to the [FG 2023 CMT system](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/fg2023/).

NOTE: List all authors during initial submission. Modifying the author list after the review process is not allowed.

**ARXIV POLICY**

**FG 2023** does not consider a paper on arXiv.org as a dual submission. This policy is adopted from CVPR 2017’s Dual/Double submission policy.

**ANONYMIZATION POLICY**

Authors should remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas of the paper. There should also be no acknowledgments. Authors can leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account. However, they should cite their own work in the third person (e.g., “[22] found that…”)
