- Workshop on Face and Gesture Analysis for COVID-19 (FG4COVID19)

  

  #### Title

  The International Workshop on Face and Gesture Analysis for COVID-19 (FG4COVID19)

  #### Description

  Since the end of 2019, the whole world has been living with the effects of the COVID-19 disease. Due to the airborne nature of the novel coronavirus, the COVID-19 disease has spread rapidly in many countries in a short time and has also been declared a global pandemic. Several preventive measures were implemented to reduce the spread of this disease, including social distancing, wearing face masks, avoiding large crowds, and others. To help monitor public behavior and compliance with the implemented prevention measures, to gather reliable data for epidemiological models, facilitate authorized access and authentication, ensure safety and security despite the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to develop automated machine learning and computer vision based techniques that can help with these tasks. The COVID-19 pandemic has initiated research and development of computer-aided systems that can be used to prevent and monitor not only COVID-19 but also similar diseases that may appear in the future. The goal of this workshop is to present the most recent and advanced work related to face and gesture analysis in the scope of COVID-19. We are interested in all COVID-19 related studies that focus on the detection of face mask, subjects' behaviors in public areas, analysis of pandemic and preventions-related real-world face and gesture data, prevention control and monitoring systems for unconstrained real-world conditions and related problems.

  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

  - Face mask detection,
  - Masked face detection and recognition,
  - Face-hand interaction detection,
  - COVID-19 monitoring and control systems related to face and gesture analysis,
  - Social distance tracking and control systems,
  - Dataset bias analysis on COVID-19 datasets (face mask, face-hand, social distance,...),
  - Face, gesture and body analysis for monitoring intervention-measure compliance,
  - Behavior understanding relevant for COVID-19,
  - Analysis of social interactions relevant to COVID-19,
  - Soft-biometric analysis on masked faces (age, gender, ...),
  - Generative models relevant in the scope of COVID-19,
  - Novel datasets and performance benchmarks,
  - Related applications

  ### Call for Workshop Proposals

  

  We invite workshop proposals for the 2021 IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2021:http://iab-rubric.org/fg2021/). Accepted workshops will be held on either December 15 or December 18, 2021.

  We solicit workshops proposals on any topic of interests to the FG community. Complementary to the main theme, we especially encourage workshop proposals that are stemmed from emerging new fields or new application domains related to face and gesture analysis and synthesis. Interdisciplinary topics that could attract a significant cross-section of the community are highly valued. Workshop organizers who have a strong track record in the field are strongly encouraged to submit a proposal.

  The workshop paper submission, review, acceptance notification, and final manuscript due must all be handled between July 30th, 2021 (suggested deadline for workshop papers) and October 20th, 2021 (camera-ready workshop paper due date). Financial support from the main conference is not guaranteed and is depending on budget. The deadline for all workshop proposals is May 10th, 2021. Decisions will be made by May 24th, 2021.

  #### WORKSHOP PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

  Workshop proposals must be sent in PDF format to the FG 2021 Workshop and Special Session Co-chairs, ZakiaHammal ([zakia_hammal@yahoo.fr](mailto:zakia_hammal@yahoo.fr)) and Jonathon Phillips ([jonathon.phillips@nist.gov](mailto:jonathon.phillips@nist.gov)) with email subject “FG 2021 Workshop Proposal: [title of your workshop]”. A proposal should include the following information to facilitate the decision process:

  - Workshop title;
  - Workshop motivation, expected outcomes and impact;
  - List of organizers including affiliation, email address, and short bio;
  - Tentative length of the workshop (half day or full day);
  - Tentative paper submission and review schedule;
  - Planned advertisement means, website hosting;
  - Paper submission procedure (submission via web site, via email, etc.) if applicable;
  - Paper review procedure (single/double-blind, internal/external, solicited/invited-only, pool of reviewers, etc.);
  - Specify the relationship, if any, to previous workshops; Describe difference with most relevant previous workshops;
  - Tentative program committee, and invited speakers, if any;
  - Estimated number of submissions and acceptance rate;
  - Special space or equipment requests, if any;
  - Specify if there will be non-peer reviewed invited paper, if so, how many?
